<h1>Description</h1>
Makropad running on RP2040, CiruitPyton and KMKfw. There are 12 keys with 3 layers, first layer is for basic desktop usage, second is for tinkercad and third is for rgb settings. The display shows .bmp images for each layer in monochomatic colors. The EVGA sticker is just for decour to honor the GPU division of the company.

<h1>Notes</h1>
KMKfw is counting with using 128x32 display, I'm using 128x64 oled so the pictures and text are stretched.
